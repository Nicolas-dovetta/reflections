1. What is your current profession/job? What did you study at Yale?

I am a engineer by training and I also have a PhD in Aerospace engineering from Ecole Polytechnique (Paris area). After working for 6 years in research and development in academia and in the industry I moved to consulting in 2016.
I am now a business consultant working for The Boston Consulting Group in Paris. I have been working there for a year and a half now, and I had the occasion to contribute to many project and missions. One of my favorite mission include helping a European bank in leveraging digital technologies to better deal with compliance laws both for anti-money laundering and embargos respects. It was a great opportunity for me both to be contributing in an industry that was unknown to me, and also to help such a company embrace future opportunities. An other mission that taught me a lot was to support a world-wide car manufacturer in its transition to Agile ways of working. I had the chance to contribute throughout the journey, from the framing of the the opportunities and benefits, to the operational implementation working day-to-day with the company’s teams.


2. How did course experience from Yale help you with your career development? 
Yale had a huge impact on my life. As a researcher in physics at the time I wanted to explore other domain and sciences. I found Yale online classes offer and  found myself re-discovering the learning experience I had loved at school. But more than that, I had the freedom to discover fields I never was appealed to as a young student, but that I was eager to explore now that school was behind me. I started with philosophy classes as “Death” from Pr. Kagan, and followed on with more business oriented classes like Game Theory from Pr. Polak and Financial markets from Pr. Schiller.

But more than 


Offered me perspective my initial training didn’t give me, and povided skills that were useseful everyday in a company job.

Allowed me to consider other careers that the one i had started

Enabled me to change path and move to consulting



3. What advice would you offer international students who are interested in your line of work?

I think that regardless of your background, it is always a good time to rediscover new fields and center of interest. Yale online classes provide a great set of supports to do that. And it is true in particular for international students for whom it may be difficult or expensive to travel and reach Yale’s classroom for real. 

Consulting skills are broad and do is the classes offer on line

Change of career with presential classes can be very difficult or impossible. Matching on’s working agenda and classes constraints is very difficult.  But with classes on line from Yale, you have both the high quality of content and the flexibility of following Robert Schiller advises at 2am on a sunday if that is what seats you.

Dear Nicolas,

Thank you for getting back to me. So far, we don't have any example for that. We only have examples for GSAS alums and International alums. Regarding to your experience, I generate questions as follows:

1. What is your current profession/job? What did you study at Yale?
2. How did course experience from Yale help you with your career development? 
3. What advice would you offer international students who are interested in your line of work?

Your feedback about those questions are also very welcome! Thank you very much again for your kind help! 

Sincerely,
Wenping

Dear Nicolas,

Not at all! Thank you very much for replying! That will be great to have people like you to share their experience. Would you be happy to share more about your experience with the online courses and how that helps you in your career development? So far Office of Career Strategy only have spotlights of GSAS students. I am working on generating a new section for international students. Anything that would benefit international students will be very much appreciated! Thank you for your kind reply again! 

Best,
Wenping

Dear Wenping,

I am very sorry for the late response. 

I would be delighted to be part of the series, however I may add that I am a strange Yale alumni. Indeed I was never strictly speaking a student, i only followed several classes online through the Yale online classes program.

Let me know what you think, but if you still want my contribution I’ll be happy to share my experience.

Best regard,
Nicolas

Dear Dr. Dovetta, 

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Wenping Zhou. I am currently a graduate student in the cell biology department at Yale, where I also serve as a graduate fellow for the Office of Career Strategy (OCS). I am focusing on international students' programming.

I'm writing to you today in regards to the OCS' GSAS Alumni Spotlight Series, which features alums who have not followed a purely academic route. I am working on the series for International alumni.  

Given your success outside of academia, I was wondering if you would by chance consider participating in the series. All that it requires is just responding (via email) to a few questions and forwarding any type of high-resolution headshot that you might like to be included in the feature. 

In advance, I appreciate all the help.

All the best,
Wenping
